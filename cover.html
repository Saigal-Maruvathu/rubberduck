        <h1>Where Have All The Rubber Ducks Gone?</h1>

        <p>In 1995 a financial transaction occured that almost no one knew about, but that has affected every human being on this planet.</p>

        <p>Barry Nano, owner of Rubber Duck, Inc. was hard on cash. He was having trouble making payroll. His employees were discontent and ready to strike. Barry had hit bottom. He needed a miracle.</p>

        <p>Tom Git got to Barry at his lowest. Tom had made a name for himself in his 20s in the Manhattan garment district, hustling PB&J sandwiches to passersby, when PB&J was still unheard of. He saw opportunity where few did. He saw opportunity in Rubber Duck, Inc.</p>

        <p>When he heard about Barry, he offered him a way out. He made him an offer he couldn't refuse.</p>

        <p>Tom purchased Rubber Duck, Inc. for 10 cents on the dollar, and made out like a Rubber Bandit. He turned the company around through economies of scale and streamlining the production process from rubber tree to completion, soon controlling every aspect of the rubber duck supply chain and overriding every anti-trust law imaginable, all while manipulating and bribing every powerful judge in the country to his benefit. He soon became a multi-million-mega-billionaire and is putting his bid in for the 2020 election.</p>

        <p>If he is not stopped, he will soon have the entire country in his bathtub.</p>

        <h1>There is hope. Introducing the Rubber Ducks For All Campaign</h1>

        <p>Imagine a world where rubber ducks flow as freely as water from a tap. Where every living (and dead) human being in the world has open access to rubber ducks. Where they are showered from the skies and thrown from parade floats.</p>

        <p>It is possible. But it can't happen without you!</p>
